***Pointer

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41kOpqSiDRE
Pointers in C++ (and most languages that support them) are passed by value:
Pointers Themselves: When you pass a pointer to a function, you're passing the address it holds by value. This means that the function gets a copy of the address, 
not the original pointer. 
If you modify the pointer inside the function (i.e., make it point somewhere else), the original pointer outside the function remains unchanged.
Data Pointed to by the Pointer: Since the function has a copy of the address that the pointer points to, it can directly access and modify the data at that address. 
Thus, when you dereference the pointer inside the function and modify the data, you're modifying the original data, not a copy of it.

Data is constant but the pointer is not. 
Pointer is constant but the data is not. (After that you can pointer for another varibale)
Data and pointer are constants.

WHEN THE POINTERS ARE USE
.Dynamic Memory Allocation:
Scenario: Consider an application like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. The text you enter into a document isn't of a fixed size; it grows and shrinks as you type or delete.
To manage this, such applications might allocate memory dynamically based on the text size, which is done using pointers in conjunction with memory management functions 
like new or malloc. Data Structures:
Scenario: Applications like web browsers keep track of which pages you've visited using a data structure called a stack. 
When you click the "back" button, the browser pops the URL off the stack. This kind of dynamic data structure is often implemented using pointers. 
Another structure is a linked list, used in scenarios where items need to be inserted or deleted frequently, like in certain types of database or list implementations.

.Function Callbacks:
Scenario: Imagine you're writing software for a robot. Different sensors on the robot trigger different actions. 
Instead of hard-coding a reaction for each sensor, you might use a function pointer. When a sensor is triggered, the appropriate function is "called back" using this pointer.
Arrays and Strings:
Scenario: Pointers can be used to iterate over arrays or strings more efficiently in certain cases, such as in embedded systems where performance is critical. Dynamic Libraries:
Scenario: Modern operating systems and applications use dynamic libraries (like .dll or .so files). When a program uses one of these libraries, it doesn't know the memory address of the functions it's calling ahead of time. 
Instead, it uses pointers to reference these functions once they're loaded into memory.

.Direct Memory Access:
Scenario: In embedded systems, hardware components are often accessed directly through specific memory addresses. Pointers are used to read from and write to these addresses.
Performance Optimization:
Scenario: In video games or graphics software, speed is crucial. Sometimes, to speed things up, developers will use pointers to access data directly,
avoiding the overhead of class methods or other abstractions. Custom Memory Management:
Scenario: In high-performance applications like databases or web servers, custom memory allocation schemes (like memory pools) can be
used to optimize memory usage patterns specific to those applications. Such custom schemes rely heavily on pointers. Interfacing with Other Languages:
Scenario: When writing software that interfaces with code written in another language (like C++ code calling a C library), 
pointers are often used to bridge the gap between the two languages. Buffer Handling in I/O Operations:
Scenario: Reading or writing files often involves using buffers, which are just blocks of memory. Pointers are used to manage and navigate these blocks of memory. 
In essence, anytime you need direct, fine-grained control over memory, or when performance is a significant concern, pointers become incredibly useful. 
However, with great power comes great responsibility. Incorrect use of pointers can lead to bugs, crashes, or security vulnerabilities, so it's essential to use them judiciously.

***Object-oriented Programming

Understanding object-oriented programming (OOP) is about thinking in terms of objects related to the problem domain. While procedural programming primarily deals with basic data types, OOP allows you to model real-world or abstract entities more effectively.
Consider you are creating software about pets. Using procedural methods, representing a cat merely with fundamental data types like int or string is impractical. A cat has attributes like age, color, breed, and behaviors like meow or purr. This is where OOP shines.
With OOP, you can define a class, say Cat, which serves as a blueprint for creating cat objects. This class can have variables for age, color, breed, and functions for actions like meowing.

Structure of OOP:
-Classes
-Objects
-Methods
-Attributes
Classes are particular data structur in other words a class is a block of code that defines a data type. The title of the class becomes the identifier for this new data type. When you create an instance of this data type, you're generating an object. By defining these custom classes, you have the capability to craft solutions that mirror the problem's context more closely. For instance, let's say you're working on software related to pets. Instead of relying solely on basic data types impractical as int or string, you can define a class called Cat. This Cat class would encapsulate attributes (like age, breed, or color) and behaviors (like meowing) specific to cats.
Object is an instance of a class. Think of it as a tangible representation of a blueprint (the class). While the class defines what attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) a cat should have, the object represents a specific cat with unique attributes and behaviors. Every object of the Cat class will possess its own set of member variables. This makes intuitive sense; without their distinct member variables, all Cat objects would be indistinguishable. e old years.
Attributes or properties of an object store the data that describes its state.
For the Cat class, typical attributes might include:
name: The cat's name.
color: The color of the cat.
Eyes: The color of the eyes of the cat.
Age: The age of the cat in years.
Number_of_legs: The number of legs of a cat
Breeds: The breed of the cat.
Methods (Behaviors):
Methods define what actions the object can perform or how it reacts to specific requests.
For the Cat class, typical methods might include:
meow(): Makes the cat meow.
purr(): Makes the cat purr.
scratch(): Makes the cat scratch something.
